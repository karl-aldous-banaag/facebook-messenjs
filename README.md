# Facebook MessenJS
Facebook MessenJS is an API wrapper for Facebook Messenger inspired by [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) that allows you to interact with [Facebook Messenger's API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/). The bot was programmed with an object-oriented approach so that people can program their Facebook Messenger chatbots with ease.
